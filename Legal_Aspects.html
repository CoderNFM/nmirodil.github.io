    <p>"From a legal standpoint, the distribution of malicious apps raises questions about liability and accountability for app developers and platform operators. As noted by ProQuest (2022), "YOU can't order at the bar, sit down and we'll bring the drinks over,' said the landlady of a Cornish pub I visited during the height of the Covid crisis.
I was told to use my mobile to scan a barcode stuck to the table. This would allow me to read the menu online. But first I had to add something called a QR reader to my smartphone. I did this in a rush, got my drinks, and haven't thought about it since. Until now that is. Earlier this month, a fraud expert told me a rogue QR reader had been found lurking in the Google Play store, where mobile apps are made available." This highlights the ease with which users can inadvertently download malicious apps, often without understanding the potential risks involved. While app store operators have implemented policies and procedures to mitigate the spread of malicious apps, the dynamic nature of cybersecurity threats necessitates ongoing legal and regulatory efforts to address emerging challenges and protect user rights.
