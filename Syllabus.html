Prerequisites
Knowledge of high school algebra.
Mason Core Course
Information technology and computing can significantly augment humans' ability to
produce, consume, process, and communicate information. Thus, students need to
understand ways to use such technology to enhance their lives, careers, and society,
while being mindful of challenges such as security, source reliability, automation, and
ethical implications. These factors have made it essential for students to understand
how to navigate the evolving technological landscape effectively. IT courses offered
in the majors may focus on disciplinary applications and concerns of information
technology.
IT courses meet the following learning outcomes:
1. Students will understand the principles of information storage, exchange, security, and
privacy and be aware of related ethical issues.
2. Students will become critical consumers of digital information; they will be capable of
selecting and evaluating appropriate, relevant, and trustworthy sources of information.
3. Students can use appropriate information and computing technologies to organize and
analyze information and use it to guide decision-making.
4. Students will be able to choose and apply appropriate algorithmic methods to solve a
problem.

Total Points 1000 100%
Course Discussions
There will be ten required course discussions throughout the semester. Each discussion is
worth 10 points. You are expected to put up your original post first and then respond to one
other post with constructive feedback.
Project Part I and II
See the project page in the lecture Blackboard folder for details.
Quizzes
There will be twelve (12) quizzes, with the two (2) lowest grades being eliminated. Thus, only ten (10)
in-class exercises count in the overall grade for the course. In-class quizzes are not announced and can
be given in lecture class or lab, at the beginning of the class, middle, or towards the end. No makeups
for any missed in-class quizzes for any reason.
Lab Schedule
Labs and their due dates are contained in the schedule.
Pretest and Posttest
Pretest and posttest are conducted in the lab. The pretest is at the beginning of the semester,
and the posttest will be in the last week. You will receive 100% as long as you participate in
both. These tests are for your Instructor to learn the areas we need to emphasize in the class.
Midterm and Final Practice Tests
Midterm and final practice tests are conducted using an assessment tool. You will be given five
attempts to take each of these tests. The best of all your attempts will be considered for your
grade. No makeups for missed practice tests for any reason.
Exams (midterm and final)
Midterm and final exams are closed book/notes and are conducted in person.
No makeups for missed exams for any reason.
Final grades will be posted to PatriotWeb, which is the only vehicle for students to obtain those
grades. A student with a "hold" on his/her Patriot Web account will be unable to access final
grades until the hold has been removed by the Registrar.
Extra Credit
You can earn up to 3% in extra credits by participating and getting 100% in the “Review
and Assessment – Chapter Exam” in the ebook - Computers: Understanding
Technology. Criteria –
1. Chapters that qualify for extra credit are – 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13.
IT 104 Spring 2024 Syllabus
Copyright © 2023. All rights reserved. 6 of 9
2. Assessment must be completed the week the chapter is reviewed in the lecture
class. Chapters are listed under Topics > Schedule at a Glance under Syllabus.
3. Each completed chapter exam will give you 0.25% extra credit.
4. You can attempt chapter exams as many times as you would want, but it has to
be completed during the week it is discussed in the lecture class.
Software
We will use several applications in the course that are already installed in computer labs.
If you cannot attend labs, you are expected to download those applications to
complete missed work. Please note that some course assignments are not compatible
with Mac operating system. If you do not have Windows operating system installed,
be sure you can log in and use Mason-provided Virtual Citrix Lab
(https://its.gmu.edu/service/citrix-virtual-lab/). If you are unable to log in, please
contact the ITS support center at 703 993 8870.
Discussion Board Conduct
The discussion board is one of the mediums we will use to communicate with our fellow
students. In postings, students are expected to conduct themselves in a manner
conducive to learning.
Please read the 10 core rules of netiquette. Any student who does not follow the 10
core rules of netiquettes and negatively impacts the opportunity for other students to
learn will be warned – if disruptive communication continues, the student will be asked
to leave the class.
Important Dates
The spring 2023 semester calendar is available on the Office of the University Registrar's
website ( https://registrar.gmu.edu/calendars/ ).
Religious Holidays
A list of religious holidays is available on the University Life Calendar page. Any student
whose religious observance conflicts with a scheduled course activity must contact the
Instructor at least two weeks in advance of the conflict date in order to make
alternative arrangements.
Attendance Policy
Students are expected to attend each class, complete any required preparatory work,
and participate actively in lectures, discussions, and exercises. As members of the
academic community, all students are expected to contribute regardless of their
proficiency with the subject matter.
IT 104 Spring 2024 Syllabus
Copyright © 2023. All rights reserved. 7 of 9
Students are expected to make prior arrangements with Instructor if they know in
advance that they will miss any class and to consult with the Instructor as soon as
possible if they miss any class without prior notice. Any student who expects to miss
more than two class sessions is strongly advised to drop the course and take it in a later
semester when he/she can attend every class.
Departmental policy requires students to take exams at the scheduled time and place
unless there are truly compelling circumstances supported by appropriate
documentation. Except in such circumstances, failure to attend a scheduled exam will
result in a score of zero (0) for that exam, in accordance with Mason's policy on final
exams. Students should not make travel plans or other discretionary arrangements that
conflict with scheduled classes and/or exams. If the University is closed due to weather
or other unforeseen conditions, final exams may be rescheduled – students are strongly
advised not to make plans that would prevent them from attending exams that may be
rescheduled during the entire exam period.
Classroom Conduct
Students are expected to conduct themselves in a manner conducive to learning, as
directed by the Instructor. Any student who negatively impacts the opportunity for other
students to learn will be warned – if disruptive behavior continues, the student will be
asked to leave the classroom.
Communications
GMU email is the preferred method of communication.
Students must use their email accounts to receive important University information,
including messages related to this class. Federal privacy law and GMU policy require
that any communication with a student related in any way to a student's status be
conducted using secure GMU systems.
Privacy
Instructors respect and protect the privacy of information related to individual
students. Instructors will take every possible measure to protect the privacy of each
student's submissions, scores, and grades.
Disability Accommodations
Any student with a disability of any kind is strongly encouraged to register with the Office of
Disability Services (ODS) (703.993.2474) as soon as possible and take advantage of the
services offered.
Accommodations for disabled students must be made in advance – ODS cannot assist students
retroactively, and at least one week's notice is required for special accommodations related to

exams. Any student who needs accommodation should contact the Instructor during the first
week of the semester so that sufficient time is allowed to make arrangements.
Honor Code
All members of the Mason community are expected to uphold the principles of scholarly ethics.
The GMU Honor System and Code will be strictly enforced in this course. Any use of the words
or ideas of another person(s) without explicit attribution that clearly identifies the material
used and its source in an appropriate manner is plagiarism and will not be tolerated.
Blackboard's SafeAssign tool is used to detect plagiarism in any work submitted by students for
this course.
For this course, the following requirements are specified:
All assessable work is to be prepared by the individual student unless the Instructor explicitly
directs otherwise.
The individual student for this course must newly create all work for this semester. Any usage
of work developed for another course or this course in a prior semester is strictly prohibited
without prior approval from the Instructor.
Students may seek assistance with assigned work (and are encouraged to do so if they feel the
need), provided the directions for the assigned work do not prohibit such assistance and
assistance is acknowledged in the submitted work, clearly identifying the person(s) giving
assistance and the nature of the assistance given.
